text: @helixion12 @glf_1950 @realDonaldTrump Driving and following the saftey rules (birth control) will minimize the chance of wreck.

Driving drunk will lead to a wreck, and people who do so are forced to accept the consequences.

And most people who aren't miserable don't refer to children as car wrecks
