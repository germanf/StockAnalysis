I would be short $NDAQ if they weren't making so much damn $$$ from frauds ($NETE, $WINS, $LFIN) listing on the @Nasdaq.  

Oh crap, I think I just wrote a Long $NDAQ pitch. https://t.co/adPugqHCah

text: @team3dstocks Lucky just until the T12 is dropped out of the blue. Those who traded $VLRX today are playing with fire, regardless of profits. One time is just enough to kill an acc. 
And this time will come, trust me. $CETC $WINS $RTNB $DGLT $LFIN
T12 while short in TZ = Account blown.

text: @Innovate_power @Nasdaq Nasdaq tried to kick them off...lost in the appeals process.  NasFraud holds onto their scams closely.  

$Wins was being investigated by SEC last time we checked but they have not brought any actions against those fraudsters yet (it's hard to repatriot $ that has gone to china)

Bonus points for explaining math around when/why puts/calls should be exercised.  Any risk-lovers that will exercise in the money calls &amp; lend it out?
